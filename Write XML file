#TEST! This should write out an XML document of your Maya scene.

#Import xml library(?) and maya's commands
from xml.dom.minidom import Document
import maya.cmds as cmds

#Name the document
doc = Document()

"""NOTE: XML's structure is like a tree. Root node must be established first and everything else that is 
under the "root" is a "child." Must append in order to add a "child" to the xml document"""

#Think of this like a header. Just includes scene name and (sometimes) encoding
root_node = doc.createElement("scene information") 

#Additions under the "root" must be appended (added).
doc.appendChild(root_node)

selection = cmds.ls(sl = True)
print selection

#Get attributes on selection and print.
for object in selection:
        print object
        object_node = doc.createElement(str(object))
        root_node.appendChild(object_node)
        
        object_translation = cmds.getAttr(object + ".translate")
        object_node.setAttribute("translateX", str(object_translation[0][0]))

#XML text file should be found in designated directory. This only writes out a document (Not read).
